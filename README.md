# 3D-Eyeglass-Frame-Augmentation-on-Camera-Feed
This project demonstrates how to overlay a 3D glasses model on a live webcam feed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The code captures a video stream from the webcam, detects facial landmarks, calculates the required rotation and position for the glasses, and overlays the glasses onto the detected face.
